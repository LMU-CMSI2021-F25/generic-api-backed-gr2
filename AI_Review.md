Artificial intelligence tools were utilized to assist in the development process, particularly for generating portions of the CSS and HTML code. These tools provided suggestions and examples that helped streamline the design and layout process. Additionally, AI was consulted for guidance in planning and structuring the JSON API, offering insights into best practices and efficient implementation methods.
All core programming logic, functionality, and final code implementation were written and verified manually. The AI served strictly as a supportive tool for idea generation, syntax suggestions, and consultation; not as a replacement for human programming or decision-making.
